# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
1. This application helps track items within a file. Taking the records of the item list and sorting them based on how many times it appears within the list.
2. It allows the user to input an item and see if the item is within the list or records. Rather than trying to find if said item is on the list manually, this time can be spent elsewhere.
3. It allows the user to see the whole list, how many items and the amount of time its shown on the list.
4. For users who like graphs, it allows users to see a histogram of the "item name" with the number next to it.

<br>#What did you do particularly well? <br>
By providing users with a menu so users know how to use the program. All the while also take into consideration user input validation. Having a backup file written for the original. And of course the comments on the codes to make them readable and also understandable even years later.

<br>#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? <br>
I can definitely use some improvements when it comes to making the program more appealing to the eye. Rather than having it do as a function plain and simple. This can help users be more willing to use the program because the feel is correct and also it works as intended. Another point is having the program work on other devices and not just one, this can boost the efficiency of getting the program spread out. Nevertheless making the codes more secure is necessary without a doubt to ease the user's mind.

<br>#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? <br>
The code that is most hard to write is making the user's input search throughout the list and give back their number. The outputting part is easy, but the actual searching is a bit difficult because C++ is limited when it comes to strings unlike Java or Python when it comes to string literals. C++ only allows you to change the characters one at a time to lower/upper case instead of the whole string. If we want to convert the string, we just use a while or for loop (better) for the string. 

<br>#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? <br>
The skill that is transferable is iterating through the file is a skill that's needed in the future as the most basic. That way I will be able to back up the files much faster than rewriting the whole thing. The skills to have good commenting is also necessary to make the codes more readable. Other skills such as having validation in the codes is important to avoid unexpected crashes and errors.

<br>#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? <br>
1. Making sure the program is maintainable through following coding standards. Making sure the codes also avoid redundancy to make the program more efficient.
2. Making the program more readable by having spaces between the codes so it will be more readable rather than sticking it all at the same line. Leaving comments on the codes also allows the programmer or even your team to understand what's happening within the codes that we have written. All the while making sure the name of the variable we chose also makes it clear to the programmer what it does.
3. Making sure the program is adaptable by not being rigid in our codes. We must think outside the box what if the user does this or that so we can accommodate them. Another is making sure not one way will be able to mess up other codes in case we have to switch them out for another set of codes.
